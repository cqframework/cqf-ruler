### **NOTICE**: The maintainers of the cqf-ruler (Alphora) and Smile Digital Health have [merged](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/11/01/2545568/0/en/Smile-Digital-Health-Expands-Product-Offering-With-Alphora-Acquisition.html)! All the functionality in the cqf-ruler is in the process of being migrated upstream to the [hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter](https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter) project

---

The cqf-ruler is based on the [HAPI FHIR JPA Server Starter](https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter) and adds a set of plugins that provide an implementation of FHIR's [Clinical Reasoning Module](
http://hl7.org/fhir/clinicalreasoning-module.html), serve as a
knowledge artifact repository, and a [cds-hooks](https://cds-hooks.org/) compatible clinical decision support service. The cqf-ruler provides an [extensibility API](#plugins) to allow adding custom FHIR operations without the need to fork or clone the entire project.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/DBCG/cqf-ruler/wiki/Home) for more information

## Usage

### Public Sandbox

The public sandbox is not persistent, has no authentication, and is regularly reset. Do not store any sensitive data, PHI, or anything you need to be persistent on the sandbox:

[GUI](https://cloud.alphora.com/sandbox/r4/cqm/)

[Open API Docs](https://cloud.alphora.com/sandbox/r4/cqm/fhir/api-docs)

[Swagger UI](https://cloud.alphora.com/sandbox/r4/cqm/fhir/swagger-ui/)

### Docker

The easiest way to get started with the cqf-ruler is to pull and run the docker image.
For avoiding to run docker container by default root user permission, the container from this image will run with a user named `cqfruler`
```bash
docker pull alphora/cqf-ruler
docker run -p 8080:8080 alphora/cqf-ruler
```

This will make the cqf-ruler available on <http://localhost:8080>

Other options for deployment are listed on the [wiki](https://github.com/DBCG/cqf-ruler/wiki/Deployment) for more documentation.

### GUI

The cqf-ruler provides the HAPI FHIR Tester UI which allows FHIR Resource CRUD at the server base url. That's <http://localhost:8080> if you're running with the Docker command above.

### Swagger / Open API

The cqf-ruler provides Swagger UI for the REST API and test interface at [http://localhost:8080/fhir/swagger-ui/](http://localhost:8080/fhir/swagger-ui/).

Similarly, Open API docs are available at [http://localhost:8080/fhir/api-docs](http://localhost:8080/fhir/api-docs).

### Example Operations

The [wiki](https://github.com/DBCG/cqf-ruler/wiki) provides walkthroughs of several of the features of the cqf-ruler such as [Quality Measure Processing](https://github.com/DBCG/cqf-ruler/wiki/Quality-Measure-Processing).

In general, you need to load the cqf-ruler with FHIR Resources prior to using it. One way to do this is to start a cqf-ruler server and use the FHIR REST API to load resources. See [Resource Loading](https://github.com/DBCG/cqf-ruler/wiki/Resource-Loading) on the wiki for a description of how to do that.

## Development

### Dependencies

#### Git Submodules

This project includes the `hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter` project as a submodule and includes the compiled classes as a jar called `cqf-ruler-external`. Be sure to use the following command when cloning this repository to ensure the submodules are initialized correctly:

`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/DBCG/cqf-ruler.git`

or if you've already checked out the repo, use

`git submodule update --init --recursive`

to clean up any unneeded or unused files, use:

`git clean -fdx`

#### Java

Go to [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/](

## Plugins

The cqf-ruler offers a basic plugin framework to allow the addition of custom FHIR operations. See [Plugins](https://github.com/DBCG/cqf-ruler/wiki/Architecture#Plugins) on the wiki for more information.

A complete example of a dynamically loaded plugin is available in the [example](/example) directory.

## Architecture

See [Architecture](https://github.com/DBCG/cqf-ruler/wiki/Architecture) on the wiki.

## Operation Migration

Several operations that once were built and exposed in the cqf-ruler have since migrated upstream into [Clinical-Reasoning](https://github.com/cqframework/clinical-reasoning) 
and exposed in versions of [Hapi-Fhir](https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir) & [Hapi-Fhir-JpaServer-Starter](https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter). 

This table maintains a current view of what operations have migrated out of this project and which are remaining. 

- Migrated = source code in Clinical-Reasoning
- To Do = source code in Cqf-Ruler
