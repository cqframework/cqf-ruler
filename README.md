The CQF Ruler is a set of plugins for the [HAPI FHIR Server](https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter) that provides an implementation of FHIR's [Clinical Reasoning Module](
http://hl7.org/fhir/clinicalreasoning-module.html) and serves as a
knowledge artifact repository and a [cds-hooks](https://cds-hooks.org/) compatible clinical decision support service. It does this via integrating a number of other CQL-related projects, which are listed below.

## Usage

### Docker

The easiest way to get started with the cqf-ruler is to pull and run the docker image

```bash
docker pull contentgroup/cqf-ruler
docker run -p 8080:8080 contentgroup/cqf-ruler
```

This will make the cqf-ruler available on `http://localhost:8080/cqf-ruler-r4`

Other options for deployment are listed on the [wiki](https://github.com/DBCG/cqf-ruler/wiki) for more documentation.

## Development

### Dependencies

#### Java

Go to [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/](
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/) and download the
latest (version 11 or higher) JDK for your platform, and install it.

#### Apache Maven 3.5.3

Go to [https://maven.apache.org](https://maven.apache.org), visit the main
"Download" page, and under "Files" download the 3.5.3 binary.  Then unpack that archive file and follow the installation
instructions in its README.txt.  The end result of this should be that the
binary "mvn" is now in your path.

### Build

`mvn package`

Builds the project war file (cqf-ruler-dstu3.war and cqf-ruler-r4.war in the projects' target directory)

Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/DBCG/cqf-ruler/wiki) for more documentation.

### Run

To run the cqf-ruler directory from this project use:

#### DSTU3

`mvn jetty:run -am --projects cqf-ruler-dstu3`

The cqf-ruler will be available at `http://localhost:8080/cqf-ruler-dstu3/`

#### R4

## Coding Conventions

The CQF Project has adopted an over-arching goal to contribute back to HAPI.
To this end:
-   The CQF Ruler project has adopted the HAPI Coding Conventions: https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir/wiki/Contributing
-   Plugins should generally use the "hapi.fhir" prefix for configuration properties

## Commit Policy

All new development takes place on `<feature>` branches off `master`. Once feature development on the branch is complete, the feature branch is submitted to `master` as a PR. The PR is reviewed by maintainers and regression testing by the CI build occurs.

Changes to the `master` branch must be done through an approved PR. Delete branches after merging to keep the repository clean.

Merges to `master` trigger a deployment to the Maven Snapshots repositories. Once ready for a release, the `master` branch is updated with the correct version number and is tagged. Tags trigger a full release to Maven Central and a corresponding release to Github. Releases SHALL NOT have a SNAPSHOT version, nor any SNAPSHOT dependencies.

## Release Process
To release a new version of CQF Ruler:
- Ensure target versions/releases of:
   - [ ] HAPI
   - [ ] CQFTooling
   - [ ] CDSHooks
- [ ] Update master to be a release version (and all the reviews, bug fixes, etc. that that requires)
   - [ ] Regression test each of the operations of all the plugins
- [ ] Passed Travis Build = ready for release
- [ ] Create a Github Release (which creates a tag at the current commit of master)
   - [ ] Choose the "Auto-generate release notes" option
- Travis does the release to Maven, ensure binaries are published to the binaries repository:
   - [ ]  r4: (https://oss.sonatype.org/#view-repositories;public~browsestorage~org/opencds/cqf/cqf-ruler-r4)
   - [ ] stu3: (https://oss.sonatype.org/#view-repositories;public~browsestorage~org/opencds/cqf/cqf-ruler-dstu3)
- Travis does the release of the image to DockerHub
   - [ ] Ensure the image is published to DockerHub (https://hub.docker.com/r/contentgroup/cqf-ruler)
- [ ] Update master to vNext-SNAPSHOT
- [ ] Ensure all issues included in the release are Closed
