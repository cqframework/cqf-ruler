# CDS Hooks Plugin

This module contains the cds-hooks implementation the cqf-ruler uses. It attempts to implement the behavior described by the [CDS Hooks Plan Definition](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/cdshooksserviceplandefinition.html) profile. This allows PlanDefinitions to be uploaded to the cqf-ruler and exposed automatically as cds-services.

See the [CDS Hooks Request Processing](https://github.com/DBCG/cqf-ruler/wiki/CDS-Hooks-Request-Processing) for more information
